# Breast-Cancer-Image-Identification
To help catch cancer early in patients with mutations in the brca2 gene, I created this machine learning tool for use in hospitals and oncology clinics. The Breast Cancer Identification algorithm takes in images and image processing data for early-stage benign and malignant breast cancer cells. It then trains multiple machine learning models using kernels of this data, and uses the most accurate model to diagnose a new breast cancer tumor cell image. This repository includes the source code for the machine learning aspect, as well as the image processing data I pulled.
